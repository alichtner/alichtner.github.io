## Project Requirements

I always start a project with my requirements. That will help me come up with a design and some constraints.

- Solidly supports my weight for pullups
- Doesn't block the doorway
- Tall enough for me
- Doesn't look terrible / isn't obviously visible

## Supplies

- 3/4" Plywood (I used Baltic Birch)
- 3/4" Galvanized Steel Pipe
- Long Wood Screws
- Tung Oil (or whatever finish you want)

## Required Equipment

- Jigsaw
- Drill
- Hole Saw
- Studfinder
- Hack Saw
- Sandpaper
- Measuring Tape
- Level
- File

## Steps

1. Decide where you're gonna want the pull-up bar. Make sure it's somewhere where you have enough head clearance to do a pull-up. Mark off where the studs are using the studfinder. 

2. Based on where the studs are relative to the wall you can figure out how long the boards need to be to hit two studs. 

3. Mark the boards out and cut them. 

4. Use the hole saw with the drill to remove the hole from where the pull-up bar will go. 

5. Then use the jigsaw to cut a slot from the board edge to the hole. 

6. Sand everything nice and smooth.

7. After making sure to remove any sawdust residue, wipe the tung oil on in a thin layer and let dry. 

8. Repeat step 7 twice more to get a thicker finish. 

9. Attach the boards into the wall making sure everything is level across the hallway. Use at least three screws in a stud. Please make sure everything is good and secure.

10. Using the hacksaw, cut the steel pipe so it just fits between your walls. This will ensure as much pipe as possible is supported by the wood brackets. File the pipe down on the ends to remove any burrs in the steel.

11. Put your steel pipe up between the two boards and you have your pull-up bar!

If you have a narrow enough hallway you too can have a custom pullup bar.
