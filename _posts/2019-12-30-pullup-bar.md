## Project Requirements

I always start a project with my requirements. That will help me come up with a design and some constraints.

- Solidly supports my weight for pullups
- Doesn't block the doorway
- Tall enough for me
- Doesn't look terrible / isn't obviously visible

## Supplies

- 3/4" Plywood (I used Baltic Birch)
- 3/4" Galvanized Steel Pipe
- Long Wood Screws
- Tung Oil (or whatever finish you want)

## Required Equipment

- Jigsaw
- Drill
- Hole Saw
- Studfinder
- Hack Saw

## Steps

1. Decide where you're gonna want the pull-up bar. Make sure it's somewhere where you have enough head clearance to do a pull-up. Mark off where the studs are using the studfinder. 

2. Based on where the studs are relative to the wall you can figure out how long the boards need to be to hit two studs. 


If you have a narrow enough hallway you too can have a custom pullup bar.
