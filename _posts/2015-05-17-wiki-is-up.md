![FreezeCasting](/public/img/FreezeCasting-644x456.png)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-casting)

One of the goals that I've had for a long time is to create the wikipedia page for [freeze-casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-casting). Even though it's a relatively "hot" technique, at least in the ceramics world. There wasn't a single entry for freeze-casting. This meant that when I started the project I actually had to read scientific literature to figure things out. The closest thing to freeze-casting on wikipedia was a topic known as [freeze-gelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_Gelation) which is really not freeze-casting. 4+ years after I started my thesis there was still nothing on wikipedia in regards to freeze-casting. I'd already done all the research and spent literally 100s of hours creating figures and getting references for the topic so I figured why shouldn't I do it. The article isn't comprehensive as there are many topics to cover but I think it does a good job at explaining the basic concepts required for freeze-casting. Apparently wikipedia however thinks it still has many problems (it was graded as a Class-C article) but it's been accepted and is available for public viewing.

For reference, a C-Class Wikipedia is defined as follows:

    
    The article is substantial, but is still missing important content or contains much irrelevant material. The article should have some references to reliable sources, but may still have significant problems or require substantial cleanup.



If you're interested please take a look, make edits if necessary and link to it if desired. Thanks for reading!
