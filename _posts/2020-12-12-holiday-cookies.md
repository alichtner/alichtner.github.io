## Dear Friends and Family,

2020 is coming to a close and I think we'd all agree that it's been a tough year. I normally don't really do gifts but this year I wanted to do something different. 

If COVID has taught me anthing, it's to recognize the small joys. Well, I don't think there's anything more apt to represent small joys than cookies. I thought it'd be nice to do something special for the people that have helped make this year a little bit better. I look forward to spending more time, in-person, with everyone in the future. 

Happy Hannukah 
and 
Happy Holidays,

Aaron

P.S. I'd love to hear which cookies you like. 

P.P.S. Some people are getting their cookies shipped, hopefully they don't get too stale. 

P.P.P.S. Yes, I know I'm extra. :p

# Recipes:

### Black and Whites

[Recipe from Sally's Baking Addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/black-and-white-cookies/#tasty-recipes-67524)

These are a Jewish cookie from New York City. It's a soft-vanilla cookie made with sour cream with two colored icings on top of it.

Ok, so I don't really like gingerbread. Except I LOVE these. I even 3D-printed a mold to put a pattern in the top.

### Walnut Rugelach

[Recipe from Ina Garten](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/rugelach-recipe-1944318)

These are also a Jewish cookie. The dough is special since it's made with cream cheese in it. They are coated in apricot jam, walnuts, cinnaomon and sugar and rolled into crescents.
