## Project Difficulty 

- 8/10 (Not for the faint of heart)

After COVID struck and gyms shut down it became pretty clear that I'd need something better than my flimsy piano bench to use as a workout bench. 
There was an influx of DIY versions of home workout equipment being advertised on instagram and youtube but nothing quite met all my requirements. 
This design represents a lot of thinking and planning and takes inspiration from some of the best other DIY designs I could find online. I'll post some of my favorite other benches below.

## Project Requirements

As usual, I started with a list of project requirements and constraints.

- Sturdy workout bench that can support my weight
- Has an adjustable back for incline and seated exercises
- Stores fitness equipment easily out of view
- Mobile enough for moving in and out of the way
- Looks nice sitting out

- Standard 2x4s 
- Standard 2x2s
- Pocket Screw Jig
- #8 Threaded Rod
- #8 washers and nuts
- Long Wood Screws
- Heavy Duty Furniture Casters
- Water-Based Polyurethane (or whatever finish you want)
- 1" Foam Badding
- 2 yards of heavy-duty vinyl / faux leather

## Required Equipment

- Circular Saw / Table Saw

## Design

The thing that I found lacking with the other DIY home workout benches is that they either had storage or were adjustable. 
None of them did both. This bench could much more easily be made as just a flat bench with storage. The final dimensions of this 
bench is supposed to be 3ft long by 14" wide and roughly 18" high (with the cushion). 

## Steps

1. First step is to build the inner frame that will provide the structure to the bench. Cut pieces A, B and C to their proper lengths. 

2. Next take two of the (A) pieces. These will have additional details added to it to make the adjustment assembly work. Use a 3/8" bit to drill the holes through piece. Then use a jigsaw to cut out the triangles as shown below. These 
are up to you where they go. They determine what angles are available for the seat to adjust to. Make sure that for the second adjustment piece you do is the mirror image of what's shown here.

3. Now assemble the frame 2x4s as shown below. I used pocket screws to put everything together, but normal wood screws through the faces would work here as well.
 The frame won't be visible from the outside so it doesn't need to be nice wood. You will use pieces A, B and C.

4. We'll build the seat adjustment assembly next. Drill holes large enough for the #8 threaded rod to go through 
.75" in from the end of both G pieces and both ends of the H pieces. Make sure this hole goes through exactly perpendicular to all the the 2x2 faces. If you have a drill press, that would be the best.

5. Next drill the same diameter hole 11.25" up from the center of the first hole on both the G pieces. 
This will act as the fulcrum point for the support arm pieces (H) to attach.

6. Assemble the adjustment assembly carefully using washers and nuts on either side of every place where the 2x2s meet threaded rod. The threaded nuts will help keep the 2x2s all in alignment and allow everything to rotate freely.

7. The final assembly should look similar to this rendering. Please note, I didn't put things together exactly in the same order since I was trying to figure things out as I was going.

2. Next cut and attach the outer walls (Pieces D, E and F) using a combination of pocket screws in the corners and screws between the baltic birch and the inner frame. 
Make sure to hide the pocket screws in the interior.

3. Attach some [heavy duty casters](https://www.amazon.com/Swivel-Caster-Wheels-Locking-Polyurethane/dp/B06Y49D2J2/ref=sxin_10?ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.b54557a1-1e55-4d28-9e82-050295431ec6.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&creativeASIN=B06Y49D2J2&cv_ct_cx=heavy+duty+casters&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.b54557a1-1e55-4d28-9e82-050295431ec6.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-gl-ranking&dchild=1&keywords=heavy+duty+casters&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B06Y49D2J2&pd_rd_r=1ea42fce-1bd8-46e9-ad64-c66519d68a91&pd_rd_w=hFAkR&pd_rd_wg=U9Xl8&pf_rd_p=69c78df1-b3ce-40ba-9ee0-ecaea903b011&pf_rd_r=9GNK33PT41BMV16CP4PX&qid=1598223053&sr=1-2-d9dc7690-f7e1-44eb-ad06-aebbef559a37&tag=cb-osp-20) 
to the bottom of the base. In the renderings I'm showing feet but I'd always planned to use locking casters. Make sure to take into account
the height of the casters for the final height. The ones for this design were 2.5" inches tall and the entire design takes that into consideration.

2. Attach the seat back.
2. Make the seat
2. Finish everything with polyurethane
2. Make the cushions
