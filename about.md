### Data Science


I am a data scientist with a strong background in research, analytics, data visualization, modeling, statistics, and machine learning. I enjoy tackling complex problems and presenting my findings through rich visuals to a variety of audiences.


### Design and Prototyping Services


I am now offering 3D design and prototyping services. I offer 3D printing in a variety of materials, laser cutting, and milling work. Please contact me if you are in need of any of these for your own work.


### Materials Science and Engineering


I earned a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering in 2015 from the University of Washington. I was a member of the [Bordia Research Group](http://www.clemson.edu/ces/departments/mse/people/faculty/bordia.html) where I studied an exciting process known as [freeze-casting](../freeze-casting).


### Passions


Creativity has always been important to me and over the years I've dabbled in everything from graphic design and photography to [vocal music](../a-cappella-arrangements/) and [cooking](http://recipes.aaronlichtner.com).
